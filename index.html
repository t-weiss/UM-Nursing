        <p>
          The Primary Care Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) program is designed
          to prepare advanced-practice nurses for the current and evolving
          primary healthcare system. Our program provides students with the
          skills needed to deliver cutting-edge, community-based primary
          healthcare to individuals and families across the lifespan. We place a
          strong emphasis on health promotion, as well as the development of
          positive health behaviors as they pertain to diverse groups at
          different developmental and age stages. Students will be required to
          attend an on-campus orientation and come to campus for three days each
          term.

        <p>
          The Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (AGPCNP) program
          is based on an understanding of health sciences theory and clinical
          preparation that shapes the knowledge, judgment, and skills necessary
          to provide primary healthcare management, health promotion, and
          disease prevention to adolescents and adults. Students will be
          required to attend an on-campus orientation and come to campus for
          three days each term.

        <h1>Clinical Placements</h1>
        <p>
          Establishing new clinical partnerships takes time. Our faculty mentors
          work one on one with students to build a program plan and ﬁnd clinical
          sites. The University of Michigan School of Nursing (UMSN) has
          hundreds of site locations — from top-ranked health systems to small
          rural clinics and specialty locations — for students to fulfill
          clinical requirements. We have partnerships with nearly every health
          system in the state of Michigan and a growing number of additional
          locations throughout the country.

        <h1>Clinical Learning Center</h1>
        <p>
          Opened in 2015, our state-of-the-art Clinical Learning Facility
          focuses on active learning that fosters greater understanding and
          advanced clinical reasoning. From simulation rooms supplied with
          high-fidelity mannequins for replicating realistic healthcare
          situations to skills labs for honing basic and advanced skills, we
          help students apply their knowledge of nursing theory in an
          interactive and safe environment.

        <h1>Clinical Placement Restrictions</h1>
        <p>
          The UMSN continually updates information regarding states where we
          cannot assure clinical placements for students enrolled in our online
          programs. This information is provided on the School of Nursing
          website; additional information is available on the University of
          Michigan website. As of September 1, 2019, we are not accepting
          applications for our online programs from students in Arizona,
          Colorado, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
          Tennessee, and Washington. Also, we are not currently accepting
          international applicants to our online programs due to regulatory,
          licensure, and placement constraints. International students are
          welcome to apply to our residential programs.
